                        Luigi aids his brother Mario in his numerous quests to save the kidnapped Peach from Bowser (although he likes Princess Daisy. Guess he's just a nice, helpful guy.) in the Super Mario games.
        
                        Since his first appearance in Mario Bros., Luigi has co-starred (and even been the main character in games such as Luigi's Mansion) in the preceding titles, including the widely-known Mario Kart series. He is a playable character in every installment. Mach 8 is his signature kart according to a trailer. He also has his own series of games called Luigi's Mansion.</p>
